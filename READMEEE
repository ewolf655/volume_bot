NOTE: The wallet you enter in config pays for jito tips and sends all the SOL/WSOL

1.
    a) Run 'npm i'

    b) Edit config.ts, wallet private key and rpc.

    c) ts-node .\main.ts

2. Run all steps in order and don't create new keypairs unless you reclaim your SOL!!!

    a) (1) Create new keypairs for your volume :))

    b) (2) Distributes SOL/WSOL
	
	i) (1) The SOL you send here is ONLY FOR GAS FEES!!! I recommend anywhere from 0.05-1

	ii) (2) This is the amount of SOL each keypair will volume spam and rotate.  
		You can enter any custom amount to look natural ;)

    c) (3) Simulate all volume and calculates all jito tip fees and raydium 5bps fee to see EXACTLY how much
	   you will spend in order to achieve the volume you want.  This took me 8 hours to do all this math so appriciate
	   it xD.

    d) (4) VOLUME BOTTT!!! At this step you have reach the step to get your volume! I recommend setting a timeout between the
	   swaps at around 3-10 seconds to look natural.

    e) (5) Retrieve all funds from the keypairs AUTOMATICALLY.  This will retrieve all the WSOL and SOL you sent and send
	   it to the wallet in the config file.
